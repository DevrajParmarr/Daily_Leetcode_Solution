Problem goes like:

Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays
You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations A and B of length n.
A prefix common array of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and B.
Return the prefix common array of A and B.

A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.
Example 1:

Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [0,2,3,4]

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findThePrefixCommonArray(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        int n=A.size();      
        vector<int> ans(n,0);
        vector<int> freq(n+1,0);

        int count=0;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){

            freq[A[i]]++;
            if(freq[A[i]]==2) count++;

            freq[B[i]]++;
            if(freq[B[i]]==2) count++;

            ans[i]=count;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
